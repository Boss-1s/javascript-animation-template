_Welcome to "Intro to Javascript"! :wave:_

In this course, you will learn how to use JS to create a car.


**What is the `draw` function?**
> The `draw function` helps us repeatedly draw the picture, so it can be animated. Somewhat like the function in a GIF.
  
### :keyboard: Activity: TBD-step-1-name

 - [ ] First, navigate to the `index.js` file on the `create-car` branch.
 - [ ] Then add the following code:<br>
   `var myBackground = color(0, 0, 255, 0.5);// You can change the name of the varible`<br>
   `background(myBackground);`<br>
   `draw = function() {`<br>
   `var drawCar = function() {// don't forget 'var'`<br>
   ` ` <br>
   `}` <br>
   `}` <br>
> var stands for varible. Varibles can replace long strings, booleans, and math equations in Prossesing JS.
 - [ ] Last step: push the changes into the `create-car` branch.
